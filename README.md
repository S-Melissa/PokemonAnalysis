# Pokemon visualization
In this project, I tried to analyze the different pokemons to get insight on their power and make a visualization about it.

**Note : as I used Tableau Public which doesn't allow file transfer, I share the different tabs I have in my analysis in different visualizations in my Tableau profile, which can also be found in the link below.**

**Questions**

*What is the strongest pokemon ?*
*What is the strongest type ?*
*What is the type repartition ?*

**Obstacles**

*I missed a dataset recording every attacks that a pokemon can learn, that would have allowed me to go further into analysis.*

**Conclusions**

*The most represented type is water and the strongest pokemon is, of course, Mega MewTwo X ! A lot of dragon pokemon are in the top strongest pokemon, which thus seems to be the strongest type.*

**Further work**

*As told in the obstacles, I would have liked to be able to go a bit deeper in the analysis, maybe to be able to predict the best possible combination of pokemons to build the strongest team.*
